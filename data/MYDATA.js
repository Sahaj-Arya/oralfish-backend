Age: Customers who are between the age of 21 and 65 years are eligible to receive the Insta EMI Card.<br />\r\n2. Regular source of income: Your Insta EMI Card limit will be determined according to your monthly income. There is a catch to this, though. If you already have many loans open, you can be given a lesser limit until you settle one of them.<br />\r\n3. City: Depending on the city you reside in, your Insta EMI Card limit may differ. This is due to the fact that larger cities often have higher incomes than smaller cities.<br />\r\n4. Credit rating: For us, your credit rating is the single most crucial consideration. Numerous organisations known as credit bureaus (TransUnion, CIBIL, Experian, etc.) keep track of all of your loans and credit cards as well as your history of payments to determine your credit score. A better credit score increases your chances of receiving the card as well as the sanctioned limit. For our application, a CIBIL Score of 720 or more is required with no past record of defaults.<br />\r\n5. Repayment history: Repaying your EMls on time is a sign of financial responsibility. Your credit score increases when you pay your EMI on time. Your credit score decreases when you don&#39;t make a monthly payment.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Step-by-step guide to applying for the Bajaj Finserv Insta EMI Card :</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>1. Enter your 10-digit mobile number and verify the OTP sent to your phone.<br />\r\n2. Fill in the application form with your basic details, such as your full name, PAN, date of birth, and PIN code.<br />\r\n3. Select your employment type and gender.<br />\r\n4. Click on submit to know your card limit.<br />\r\n5. Verify your KYC using your Aadhaar card or DigiLocker.<br />\r\n6. Post successful KYC, pay a one-time joining fee of Rs. 599/-.<br />\r\n7. Click on &lsquo;Activate Now&rsquo; and enter your bank account number and IFSC code to complete the e-mandate process.<br />\r\n8. After successful e-mandate registration, your card is ready to use.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Note: The online process may differ depending on whether you are a new customer or have an existing relationship with us.</p>\r\n<quillbot-extension-portal></quillbot-extension-portal>",

    desc: "<p>Demat accounts were introduced in India in 1996, before which shares and securities were physically issued and traded. The importance of opening a free Demat account is such that it allows the investors to hold their securities electronically in their Demat accounts. This makes the entire procedure of investing, holding, monitoring, and trading, faster, convenient, and cost-efficient.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Benefits of a Demat account</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b</strong>These are some of the advantages of a Demat account:</p>\r\n\r\n<ol>\r\n\t<li>Lower risks</li>\r\n\t<li>Easy holding</li>\r\n\t<li>Odd lots</li>\r\n\t<li>Reduced costs</li>\r\n\t<li>Reduced time&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n\r\n<p>Lower risks:<br />\r\nPhysical securities are risky due to thefts, losses, or damages. In addition, bad deliveries or fake securities pose further risks. These risks are eliminated with the opening of a Demat account, which provides holders with the option of holding all their investments in electronic form..</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Easy holding:<br />\r\nMaintaining physical certificates is a tedious job. Moreover, keeping track of their performance is an added responsibility. Demat account holders can make it more convenient to hold and track all their investments through a single account.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Odd lots:<br />\r\nWith physical certificates, buying and selling were possible only in the specified quantities. The convenience of dealing with odd lots or single security was also not available. Demat accounts eliminate this issue.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Reduced costs:<br />\r\nPhysical certificates involved several additional costs, such as stamp duty, handling charges, and other such expenses. These extra expenses are eliminated with Demat accounts.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Reduced time:<br />\r\nDue to the elimination of paperwork, the time required in completing a transaction gets reduced. The reduced time requirement enables the account holder to make more purchases and sales of security holdings in a shorter time and with greater efficiency.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Demat accounts are simple, fuss-free and extremely lucrative. In today&rsquo;s day and age, they are a must for financial planning.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Features of Demat account</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b</strong>Easy share transfers:<br />\r\nInvestors can transfer their holdings through a delivery instruction slip (DIS) or receipt instruction slip (RIS) for buying or selling shares. These slips allow users to provide all the details that are required for executing a transaction smoothly.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Faster dematerialisation &amp; rematerialisation of securities:<br />\r\nDemat account holders can provide instructions to their depository participant (DP) to convert physical certificates into electronic form. Alternatively, electronic securities can also be reconverted to physical form, if required.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Pledging facility to avail loan:<br />\r\nSeveral lenders provide loans against securities that are held in the Demat account of the borrowers. These holdings are used as collateral to avail loans by the account holders.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Freezing Demat accounts:<br />\r\nDemat account holders can freeze their accounts for a certain period, if required. This option can be beneficial if one wants to prevent unexpected debit or credit into one&rsquo;s Demat account. The freezing option is also available for a specific quantity of securities held in the account.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Multiple accessing options:<br />\r\nDemat accounts are operated electronically, which means these can be accessed using multiple modes.

    desc: "<p><strong>What are the Features of Demat Account</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Prior to 1996, shares and securities were physically issued and traded in the stock market. But then in 1996, the Securities and Exchange Board of India introduced the concept of Dematerialisation. This changed the trading landscape drastically as investors could trade from anywhere with access to the internet. Demat account also expedites, simplifies, and lowers the cost of holding, investing, monitoring, and trading.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Why do you Need a Demat Account?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>As per law, an investor can hold securities in either physical or electronic form and converting physical securities to electronic form is optional. However, in contrast to their dematerialized counterparts, monitoring physical certificates is more challenging. Furthermore, purchasing or selling shares in person is a hassle and time-consuming. This is why having a Demat account is recommended.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Features Of A Demat Account</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Easy Share Transfers - When buying or selling shares, investors can transfer their holdings quickly using an electronic Delivery Instruction Slip (e-DIS). Users are able to include all the information necessary for a transaction to go smoothly on these slips. Freezing Demat Accounts - Owners of Demat accounts have the option, if necessary, to temporarily freeze their accounts. If one wants to stop unauthorised debits or credits from being made to a Demat account, this option may be helpful. The option to freeze securities held in the account up to a certain amount is also accessible. Pledging Facility To Avail Loan - A number of brokers offer loans secured by securities that the borrowers have in their Demat accounts. The account holders utilise these holdings as security when applying for loans. SPEED E-Facility - Users can send instruction slips electronically through the National Securities Depository Limited rather than handing them in to the DP. As a result, the process is quicker and more convenient. Multiple Accessing Options - Demat accounts can be accessed in a variety of ways because they are managed electronically. Using a computer, smartphone, or other smart device connected to the Internet, you can access these accounts. Corporate Benefits &amp; Actions - The owners of Demat accounts are automatically eligible for any dividends, credits, or interest that the corporations offer to their investors. Additionally, all shareholders&#39; Demat accounts are automatically updated with information regarding company actions such as bonus issuance, right shares, or stock splits.<br />\r\nBenefits of Demat Account</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Easy Holding - Physical share certificate maintenance is a laborious task. Additionally, monitoring their performance is an additional duty. Holders of Demat accounts often find it easier to hold and manage all of their investments in a single account. Lower Risks - Due to losses, thefts or damages, trading physical certificates is dangerous. Additional dangers include phoney securities and faulty deliveries. By establishing a Demat account, holders have the option of keeping all of their investments in electronic form, eliminating these dangers. Reduced Costs - Physical certificates came with a number of extra expenditures, including stamp duty, handling fees and other such charges. These extra charges are nullified with a Demat account. Odd Lots - Prior to Dematerialisation , buying and selling of only fixed quantities was allowed. This presented a problem of odd lots. Demat accounts have resolved this problem. Reduced Time - The time needed to complete a transaction has decreased as a result of the absence of documentation. The account holder can buy and sell securities more quickly and effectively thanks to Demat accounts.<br />\r\nPhysically visiting branch offices and filling out Demat account applications is a thing of the past. You can now open a Demat account from the comfort of your home in less than 5 minutes with m.Stock and trade free for life across products.</p>",
